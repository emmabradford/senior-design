As a person looking for books to read, I want a service to recommend new books so that I have a means of finding new material to read.

As a person who doesnâ€™t have a lot of free time, I want to filter books by their length or word count so that I can find new books that I can read within a short amount of time.

As someone with little disposable income, I want to select a number of book recommendations in advance so that I can get a suitable number of good recommendations without being overwhelmed.

As an avid horror fan, I want to select books based on genre so that I can obtain books relevant to my interests.
